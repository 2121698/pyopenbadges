# OpenBadge v3.0 Specification

[![üá´üá∑ Version fran√ßaise](https://img.shields.io/badge/üá´üá∑_Version_fran√ßaise-blue.svg)](SPECIFICATION.fr.md)

This document summarizes the OpenBadge v3.0 specifications according to IMS Global standards. It will serve as a guide for the implementation of our Python library.

## 1. Introduction

OpenBadges v3.0 is a standard format for representing and verifying digital badges. Version 3.0 is based on W3C Verifiable Credentials and brings several improvements compared to v2.0.

## 1.1 Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are a W3C standard for digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified. They are a core component of OpenBadge v3.0.

### Key Concepts

- **Verifiable Credential**: A tamper-evident credential with authorship that can be cryptographically verified
- **Issuer**: The entity that creates and signs the credential
- **Subject**: The entity about which claims are made (the recipient of a badge)
- **Verifier**: Any entity that needs to verify the credential's authenticity

### Structure of a Verifiable Credential

A Verifiable Credential consists of:

1. **Metadata**: Information about the credential itself (ID, type, issuance date, etc.)
2. **Claims**: Statements about the subject (in OpenBadges, this includes the achievement)
3. **Proof**: Cryptographic proof that makes the credential verifiable

### Verification Process

The verification of a Verifiable Credential involves:

1. Checking the credential's signature using the issuer's public key
2. Verifying that the credential hasn't been revoked or expired
3. Validating that the credential conforms to the expected schema

In PyOpenBadges, the `OpenBadgeCredential` model implements the Verifiable Credential standard, with the `proof` field containing the cryptographic signature.

## 2. General Structure

An OpenBadge v3.0 badge consists of several interconnected elements:

- **Profile** (formerly Issuer): The entity that issues the badge
- **Achievement** (formerly BadgeClass): The badge definition
- **Credential** (formerly Assertion): The attribution of a specific badge to a recipient
- **Endorsement**: A recommendation or validation by a third party

These elements are represented in JSON-LD format (JSON with Linked Data context).

## 3. Main Components

### 3.1 Profile (Issuer)

Represents the entity that issues badges.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v3",

      "type": "Achievement"
    }
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "Ed25519Signature2020",
    "created": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "verificationMethod": "https://example.org/issuers/1/keys/1",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "proofValue": "..."
  }
}
```
